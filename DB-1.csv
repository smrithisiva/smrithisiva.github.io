Program Integrity ? Pallium / FWA AI,Solution ,"The FWA / Pallium AI/ML based models can be used to monitor program integrity and identify fraud, waste, and abuse to identify claims-based savings for healthcare payors. The model utilizes supervised and unsupervised learning to train models to identify patterns and separate data into different groups as well as forecast future actions. The model can identify the likelihood of a claim to be overpaid before the original claim goes out for payment, thereby reducing the cost of recovery. The model can also use sparse data estimation to identify unlikely charges.

Intelligent Secure Messaging,Solution ,"Deloitte followed a two-pronged artificial intelligence driven approach to decrease manual effort: 1.Preemptive Communication: Using natural language processing, messages were categorized to form frequently asked questions, allowing for provider education to preemptively address the FAQs using available self-service tools and reduce the volume of future incoming  messages. 2.Intelligent Automated Responses: Using machine learning, models were created to read provider messages, predict message response, and reply to the providers without human interaction. Likely to Adjust: Predict if the claim associated for an incoming secure message will be adjusted, Likely to Re-inquire:  Predict if a provider is likely to re-inquire on an incoming secure message via secure message or other correspondence channel such as call center, mail, or fax, Rule Based Automation: Conduct NLP on the incoming provider questions to categorize under specific categories and automatically respond using pre-determined templates.",Healthcare ,Health Plan - CM/UM,"Projected decrease of ~3% in incoming provider questions based on preemptive FAQ approach, projected decrease of ~9-12% in manual effort for secure messaging team through intelligent automated responses and improve accuracy and response time to provider messages, increasing provider satisfaction","NLP, machine learning",6,1,TBD,TBD,Art Fitts,Fatema Samiwala,98,"AI, ML, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, health plan, plan, preemptive communication, intelligent automated responses, rule based automation, NLP, incoming provider questions, provider satisfaction, improved accuracy, improved response, provider messages, CM, UM, care management, utilization management, messaging, messages, plan, health plan, enquiry, re-enquiry, claims adjustment, communication, secure messaging, correspondence, provider correspondence, predict response, predict provider response, predict re-enquiry, predict reenquiry",Intelligent Secure Messaging.png
